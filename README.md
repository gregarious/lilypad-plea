# Lilypad PLEA

A single-page app for Lilypad at PLEA.

## Installation (for dev machines)

If using on a development machine in conjunction with `lilypad-server`, this repository's
directory __must__ be named `lilypad-plea`, and it's parent directory must be set in the
server's virtual environment (see `lilypad-server`'s README for details).

## Code introduction

See [this article](https://github.com/gregarious/lilypad-pace/blob/master/angular-lilypad-intro.md).
It was written specifically for `lilypad-pace` but the vast majority of it is applicable
to both client apps.
